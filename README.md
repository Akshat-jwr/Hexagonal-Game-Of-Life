# Hexagonal Game of Life

A fun variation of Conway’s Game of Life built on a **hexagonal grid**, implemented in C++ as a personal task in early 2024.

## What to Expect

- A console-based simulation of life-like behavior on a hexagonal grid
- Customizable grid size and initial state
- Simple rule-based evolution using hexagonal neighborhood logic

Built for exploration and learning — modify it, experiment with rules, and enjoy the emergent patterns!

## Files

- `HexagonalGameOfLife.cpp`: Main source code
- `HexagonalGameOfLife/`: (Optional) Folder for supporting resources

## Build and Run

Compile using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ HexagonalGameOfLife.cpp -o HexLife
./HexLife
```
Take a look at the code and its running and find out what its altered rules are!!
